# Secured Crosschain Flex-Bid Protocol



## Overview
The Secured Crosschain Flex-Bid Protocol is a blockchain solution designed to enable secure and efficient cross-chain bidding processes. This protocol ensures that bids are safely locked, routed, and settled across different blockchain networks, leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, oracles, relayers, and challengers to maintain integrity and security.



## Key Features

Cross-Chain Bid Routing: Efficiently routes bids across multiple blockchain layers.

+ **Secure Locking Mechanism:** Ensures ETH is securely locked on the mainchain during the bidding process.
+ **Relayer and Challenger System:** Relayers publish staked transactions to the destination blockchain, while challengers monitor and verify the integrity of these transactions.
+ **Oracle Integration:** Uses oracles to listen to events and trigger actions across chains.
+ **High Security:** The protocol's main strength lies in its security features, which safeguard against fraudulent or faulty transactions.

## Project Structure
+ **Mainchain Locker Contract:** Smart contract responsible for locking ETH on the mainchain.
+ **Oracle:** Listens to events on the mainchain and relays information to the sidechain.
+ **Router Contract:** Deployed on the sidechain, responsible for routing bids and managing the cross-chain interaction.
+ **Relayers:** Entities that publish transactions to the destination blockchain.
+ **Challengers:** Monitor relayers and can challenge any suspected faulty transactions.


## Tehnologies Used

+ Ethereum & Solidity: Smart contracts written in Solidity deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
+ Oracles: Custom oracles for event listening and communication across chains.
+ React: Frontend developed using React.
+ ThirdWeb: Integration of ThirdWeb technologies for decentralized application management.

## Installation
**Prerequisites**
+ Node.js
+ Truffle
+ Ganache (for local Ethereum Network)
+ ThirdWeb SDK

**Steps**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secured-crosschain-flex-bid-protocol.git
   cd secured-crosschain-flex-bid-protocol

2. ### Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
3. ### Compile Contracts
   ```bash
   truffle compile
4. ### Migrate Contracts
   ```bash
   truffle migrate

## Usage
1. Deploy the oracle script

   ```bash
   node oracle.js
2. **Using the interaction script:** Uncomment every number of the script one by one and make sure you've other numbers commented while running one number.
   
   Flow of the execution:
   + Locking of Assets and creating a new bid.
   + Setting a new relayer.
   + Check the relayer details.
   + Fetch the bid details from layers.
   + Bidding of transaction by relayers.

   ```bash
   node DestinationOracle.js

3. **Deploy DestinationOracle:**

   ```bash
   node DestinationOracle.js
4. **Publishing of Transaction in Challenger contract:**
   
   ```bash
   node PublishTransaction.js

After execution of above steps, if incase their is a conflict or fraudulent activity by relayer, resolving mechanism is emitted. Here, we've idealized the behavior of challenger.
